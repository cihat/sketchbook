# Cache Mechanism Learning Project

## Project Title
"Mini Cache Manager: Multi-Level Cache System Implementation"

## Project Description
Develop a basic web application that implements different levels of caching mechanisms (memory cache, file cache, and distributed cache) and allows you to compare performance results. This project will consist of a simple REST API that retrieves certain data but applies different caching strategies.

## Key Concepts to Learn (Keywords)
- Cache hit/miss
- Cache invalidation
- TTL (Time-To-Live)
- Cache replacement policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
- Cache eviction
- Cache coherence
- Multilevel caching
- Write-through vs write-back
- Cache warm-up
- Cache poisoning

## Project Steps
1. Create a simple HTTP API (returning data upon request)
2. Add an in-memory cache layer
3. Add a file-based secondary cache layer
4. Add a distributed cache layer using Redis or Memcached
5. Implement different TTL (Time-To-Live) strategies for each layer
6. Add metrics to monitor cache hit/miss ratios
7. Implement different eviction policies for each layer
8. Create performance test scenarios and compare results

## Technical Details for the Project
- How to integrate different cache levels
- How to generate cache keys
- Cache behavior in parallel request scenarios
- How to ensure cache consistency
- Cache warm-up strategies
- Methods to prevent cache poisoning

## Performance Metrics
- Response time per request
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory consumption
- Cache refresh time
- Stale data cleanup speed

This project will help you understand caching mechanisms in a practical way. By proceeding step by step, you will experience the advantages and disadvantages of each cache level. Upon completing the project, you will have comprehensive knowledge about using caches in real-world applications.
